        <h2>Resonance...</h2>
        <p>When a second tuning fork of the same (precise) size and pitch, is placed in the vicinity of a “resonating” or vibrating tuning fork, the energy of the resonating tuning fork causes the second tuning fork to vibrate or resonate as well. The propagating effects of a focused, precise and harmonic energy is the model of the principles of life and even of life itself. If our ideas, our behavior, our living are all based upon a universal and precise “resonating energy,” we resonate together – just as the tuning forks.</p>
